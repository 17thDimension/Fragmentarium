Fragmentarium is a cross-platform application for exploring pixel based graphics on the GPU.

It is similar to Adobe's Pixel Bender, but uses pure GLSL.

Features:

 * Multi-tabbed IDE
 * User widgets to manipulate parameter settings.
 * GLSL syntax high-lighting
 * Different 'mouse to GLSL' mapping schemes
 * Modular GLSL programming - include other fragments
 * Includes simple raytracer for distance estimated systems

Fragmentarium is built in C++, OpenGL/GLSL, and Qt 4.

Fragmentarium is currently at the prototype stage: syntax and UI is likely to change, and there are probably plenty of errors.
