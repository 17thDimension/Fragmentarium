Fragmentarium is a cross-platform application for exploring pixel based graphics on the GPU.

It is similar to Adobe's Pixel Bender, but uses pure GLSL.

Features:

 * Multi-tabbed IDE, with GLSL syntax highlighting
 * User widgets to manipulate parameter settings.
 * Different 'mouse to GLSL' mapping schemes
 * Modular GLSL programming - include other fragments
 * Includes simple raytracer for distance estimated systems
 * Many examples including Mandelbulb, Mandelbox, Kaleidoscopic IFS, and Julia Quaternion.   

Fragmentarium is built in C++, OpenGL/GLSL, and Qt 4.

Fragmentarium is currently in the early development phase, so expect some rough edges!
