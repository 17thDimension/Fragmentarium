--------
+ #Include "x.frag"
+ #info "..."
+ #replace "x.frag" "t.frag"
+ ShaderSource class
+ 2D CameraControl
  + Antialias
+ 3D CameraControl
  + Antialias
+ Magic Uniforms
  + vec2 pixelsize (in model-coordinates)
  + float time (seconds)
+ GUI Uniforms
  + uniform float a; slider[-2,3,3]
  + uniform int a; slider[-2,3,3]
  + Comments before GUI uniforms should become tooltips
  + uniform vec3 a; colorchooser[1,0.9,0.8]
  + uniform vec3 a; slider[(0,0,0),(0.5,0.5,0.5),(1,1,1)]
  + Groups
+ Textures.
  
+ Better Syntax Highligtning.
+ Control of line numbers 
  (+GLSL debug working)
