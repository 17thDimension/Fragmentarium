Roadmap.
--------
+ #Include "x.frag"
+ #info "..."
+ #replace "x.frag" "t.frag"
+ ShaderSource class
+ 2D CameraControl
  + Antialias
+ 3D CameraControl
  + Antialias
+ Magic Uniforms
  + vec2 pixelsize (in model-coordinates)
  + float time (seconds)
+ GUI Uniforms
  + uniform float a; slider[-2,3,3]
  + uniform int a; slider[-2,3,3]
  + Comments before GUI uniforms should become tooltips
  + uniform vec3 a; colorchooser[1,0.9,0.8]
  + uniform vec3 a; slider[(0,0,0),(0.5,0.5,0.5),(1,1,1)]
  + Groups
+ Textures.
  
+ Better Syntax Highligtning.
+ Control of line numbers 
  (+GLSL debug working)
+ Write out Camera hints after rendering
+ Fix: Splash
+ add three glsl output lines -> Plus make it an Run button thingy
  -> glsl debug doesn't work?
+ Simple website.

<-- First Release: Version 0.5 -- 

+ Control FOV for 3D camera
+ Blending to background seems wrong in raytracer
+ uniform vec2 a; slider[(0,0),(0.5,0.5),(1,1)]

+ Hires renders.
+ Better cameras (esp. 3D)
  + Clipping? (What can we do here?)
  + Sliders for cameras
  + Save to settings
  + Rotation in screen space
  + A 3D camera suitable for deep zooming
  + Better mouse mapping for cameras
+ Tile based renders.
+ Animation timeline.
+ Better support for preview: render-to-texture (using FBO's) and rescale.
+ Preset support

<-- Version 0.8 --

Some of these:
- Mouse sensitivity
- Choose 'uniform' or 'constant' for GUI sliders (last option will require recompile when changed)
- Update raytracer: inner glow, hard shadows, new AO?
- uniform vec4 a; slider[....]
- Fix: icons
- Resize trigger many updates (hang)
- Example Path : examples/
- A 2D camera which scales from the current mouse position

<-- Version 0.9 --

Some of these:
- Clipping planes
- Startup screen with images?
- Update raytracer: environment mapping?
- Check for updates
- WebGL export
- Keyframe Animation.
- Post processing (add another render step to FBO): HDR, Blur, ...
<-- Version 1.0 --
