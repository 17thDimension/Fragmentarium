Prerequisites
=============

First install Qt Open Source for Mac:
http://qt-project.org/downloads

Download
========

Now check out the source:

    git clone https://github.com/Syntopia/Fragmentarium.git

and type the following:

    cd Fragmentarium/Fragmentarium-Source/
    qmake -project -after "CONFIG += opengl"
    qmake -spec macx-xcode Fragmentarium-Source.pro

Now an XCode project file has been created. Open this file in XCode.

Right click on the "Frameworks" and add QtWidgets.framework and QtOpenGL.framework by browsing to their locations at [Qt install location]/[version]/[platform]/lib/ (e.g. ~/Qt/5.3/clang_64/lib).
The header files now need to be added: click on project and go to the Build tab. Add the following header search paths:

    '[Qt install location]/[version]/[platform]/lib/QtWidgets.framework/Versions/5/Headers'
    '[Qt install location]/[version]/[platform]/lib/QtOpenGL.framework/Versions/5/Headers'

You may also need to do the same for QtScript.framework and QtXml.framework.
It might also be necessary to add the SyntopiaCore folder and check the recursive flag.
It should now be possible to compile and run Fragmentium from XCode.
