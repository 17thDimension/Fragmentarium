First install Qt Open Source for Mac (version 4.5.0 or later):
http://qt.nokia.com/downloads

Now check out the source:
git clone https://github.com/Syntopia/Fragmentarium.git

and type the following:

cd Fragmentarium/Fragmentarium-Source/
qmake -project -after "CONFIG += opengl"
qmake -spec macx-xcode Fragmentarium.pro

Now an XCode project file has been created. Open this file in XCode.

Right click on the "External Frameworks and Libraries" and add QtScript.framework, QtOpenGL.framework and QtXml.framework by browsing to their locations. 
The header files now need to be added: go to 'Project | Edit Active Target 'Fragmentarium'' and go to the Build tab. Add the following header search paths:

'/Library/Frameworks/QtOpenGL.framework/Headers' 
'/Library/Frameworks/QtScript.framework/Headers' 
'/Library/Frameworks/QtXML.framework/Headers'

It might also be necessary to add the SyntopiaCore folder and check the recursive flag.
It should now be possible to compile and run Fragmentium from XCode.
