TODO list and scratch pad for Fragmentarium. /Mikael
-----------
I've released a new build of Fragmentarium, version 0.8, with some useful updates, including better camera control, high resolution render and animation.

New features:
- The 3D camera has been rewritten: it is now a "first-person", pinhole camera (like Boxplorer and Fractal Lab), and is controllable using mouse and keyboard. Camera view can now be saved together with other setings.
- Arbitrary resolution renderings (using tile based rendering - the GPU won't time out).
- Preview modes (renders to FBO with lower resolution and rescales). 
- 'Tile preview' for previewing part of high-resolution renders.
- Animation controller (experimental: no keyframes yet, you must animate using the system supplied 'time' variable. Animation is output as a sequence of still images).
- Presets (group parameters settings and load them into a dropbox)
- New fractals: QuaternionMandelbrot4D, Ducks, NewMenger.
- Improved raytracer: dithering, fog, new coloring schemes.

Update web:
Install Qt 4.7.1.
Set the QT4DIR environment variable to the Qt installation directory (Typically: C:\Qt\4.7.1)
Open the Fragmentarium.sln Visual Studio 2008 solution file (located in the 'Build - Windows' dir).

Now you should be able to compile Fragmentarium.

To run it you must copy the following Qt DLL's from the Qt 'bin' folder (e.g. C:\Qt\4.7.1\bin) to the VS build folder (e.g. 'release'):
QtCore4.dll, QtOpenGL4.dll, QtGui4.dll
Notice, that debug DLLs contain a 'd'-suffix (e.g. QtCore4d.dll).

Now Fragmentarium should run from inside Visual Studio, but it will not find its examples unless the working directory is set: Under Project properties, set the "Configuration Properties | Debugging | Working Directory" to ".."

It is possible to create a deployable by running the 'Build - Windows/createDeploy.bat' script.
