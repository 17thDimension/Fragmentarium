TODO list and scratch pad for Fragmentarium. /Mikael
-----------
I've released a new build of Fragmentarium, version 0.9 ("Sun Ra").

New major features:

- New high resolution output dialog (with auto-naming and auto-backup of scripts and parameters)
- Locking of parameters (makes rendering up to 4x faster)

Minor improvements:

- Mousewheel now changes camera position, not FOV
- Raytracer improvement:
  - Removed 'AntiAliasBlur','MaxRayStepDiv', and 'NormalDetail' setting
  - Added reflection, hardShadows
  - Added dithering (for banding removal) and very simple RNG functionality.
  - Added new ambient occlusion method (similar to Rrola/Subblue - sample along normal for proximity).
- Added a port of Subblues Fractal Labs (fractal.io) raytracer. Just include "Subblue-Raytracer.frag" instead of "DE-Raytracer.frag"
- Added vertical scroll to user parameter groups.
- Added '#define providesInit', '#define providesColor'
- Now disables uniformes which are not used in shader.
- Bugfix: resize of window now updates aspect ratio.
- Bugfix: handling of specular exponent = 0
- BugFix: fixed fps timer for >500ms renders

New fragments:

- Added GraphPlotter.frag, KaliSet.frag, BurningShip.frag, Spudsville.frag,
- Added Knighty's:
- Added 2DJulia.frag and Complex.frag to make 2D fractals easier.
