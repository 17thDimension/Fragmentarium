TODO list and scratch pad for Fragmentarium. /Mikael
-----------
I've released a new build of Fragmentarium, version 0.9 ("Sun Ra").

New major features:

- New high resolution output dialog (with auto-naming and auto-backup of scripts and parameters)
- Locking of parameters (makes rendering up to 4x faster)

Minor improvements:

- Mousewheel now changes camera position, not FOV
- Raytracer improvement:
  - Removed 'AntiAliasBlur','MaxRayStepDiv', and 'NormalDetail' setting
  - Added reflection
  - Shadows (hard, and pseudo-soft shadows)
  - Added dithering (for banding removal) and very simple RNG functionality.
  - Added new ambient occlusion method (similar to Rrola/Subblue - sample along normal for proximity).
- Added a port of Subblues Fractal Labs (fractal.io) raytracer (GPL). Just include "Subblue-Raytracer.frag" instead of "DE-Raytracer.frag"
- Added vertical scroll to user parameter groups.
- Added '#define providesInit', '#define providesColor' (to provide custom coloring)
- Added vec4 GUI slider type
- Now disables uniformes which are not used in shader.
- Compiler warnings are now shown in output, also if there is no errors.
- Bugfix: resize of window now updates aspect ratio.
- Bugfix: handling of specular exponent = 0
- BugFix: fixed fps timer for >500ms renders
- BugFix: Tile Render now works in manual mode.
- BugFix: Using mouse and key movement at the same time, would result in distance between eye and target getting smaller and smaller.

New fragments:

- GraphPlotter.frag, KaliSet.frag, BurningShip.frag, Spudsville.frag,
- Knighty's:
- 2DJulia.frag and Complex.frag to make 2D fractals easier.
- Subblue-Raytracer.frag
- QuilezLib with sphere tracing primitives (http://iquilezles.org/www/articles/distfunctions/distfunctions.htm)
- Ashima-Noise.frag: Noise founctions from: http://www.lighthouse3d.com/2011/03/noise-for-glsl/

Comments:

2D-Escape time fractals are very easy to explore now. Here is an example:

#include "2DJulia.frag"
#include "Complex.frag"

// 'Ducks' fractal by Samuel Monnier
vec2 formula(vec2 z, vec2 c) {
    return cLog(vec2(z.x,abs(z.y)))+c;
}
