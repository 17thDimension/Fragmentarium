TODO list and scratch pad for Fragmentarium. /Mikael

0(14) : warning C7504: OpenGL does not allow writing to input variable 'gl_Vertex'

- Timeline for $time animations.
- Colors should be lightened...

Update web:
Install Qt 4.7.1.
Set the QT4DIR environment variable to the Qt installation directory (Typically: C:\Qt\4.7.1)
Open the Fragmentarium.sln Visual Studio 2008 solution file (located in the 'Build - Windows' dir).

Now you should be able to compile Fragmentarium.

To run it you must copy the following Qt DLL's from the Qt 'bin' folder (e.g. C:\Qt\4.7.1\bin) to the VS build folder (e.g. 'release'):
QtCore4.dll, QtOpenGL4.dll, QtGui4.dll
Notice, that debug DLLs contain a 'd'-suffix (e.g. QtCore4d.dll).

Now Fragmentarium should run from inside Visual Studio, but it will not find its examples unless the working directory is set: Under Project properties, set the "Configuration Properties | Debugging | Working Directory" to ".."

It is possible to create a deployable by running the 'Build - Windows/createDeploy.bat' script.
